Avis Client Library
======================================================================

The Avis Client Library provides a high level API for Java clients
communicating with an Elvin router. It is based on the same
foundations as the Avis router, but is made available under the terms
of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) rather than the GPL
used by the router.

 * [Download the client library][download].

 * [View Javadoc API documentation][javadoc] for the latest version of
   the library.

The client library package contains a number of programming examples
in `src/examples` and documentation on how to use them in
`doc/examples.txt`.

You can also see examples of the client library in use at the
[examples page][examples].
