About Avis
======================================================================

Avis is an event router service compatible with the commercial Elvin
implementation developed by [Mantara Software][mantara]. Avis provides
a general-purpose, fast and scalable publish/subscribe message bus
using content-based subscriptions.

Elvin event routers enable arbitrary messages, known as
*notifications*, to be exchanged via a publish/subscribe model. Elvin
clients subscribe to messages using expressions that match messages by
their content, an approach that differs from many other message bus
systems that operate by selecting messages published on pre-defined
channels. This promotes an even higher level of decoupling between
producers and consumers of events.

Elvin routers can also be federated to construct high-efficiency,
wide-area event networks.

The name "Avis" derives from the French word *avis*, meaning advice or
notification.


Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Current uses for Elvin event routers include providing the message bus
for [instant messaging and virtual presence][tickertape.org], device
coordination for smart meeting rooms and [distributed speech
transcription for meetings][AuTM]. It has also been used extensively
by Mantara for high-volume financial transaction routing.

Elvin has been picked up in so many applications because of its
lightweight approach and flexibility: see [this page][why_avis] for
more discussion on why you might want to use it. The [examples][] page
also demonstrates in more detail a scenario in which it can be
employed.


Current Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Avis is currently stable enough to be usable as a drop-in replacement
for Mantara's commercial `elvind` if quench and federation are not
required.

Future development items include:

 * A Java client library providing a similar capability to Mantara's
   `je4` library. At this stage, Avis is only useful as a router for
   existing Elvin clients using Mantara's client programming
   libraries. This library will be released under the LGPL.

 * An `ewafd`-style federator to fill in until real federation is
   implemented. This style of federation essentially federates using a
   special client to exchange notifications between servers.

 * Implementing the *quench* API for allowing producers to discover
   what clients are listening for.

See the [roadmap page][roadmap] for more information on what's planned
for Avis.


History
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elvin orginated as a project at the [Distributed Systems Technology
Centre][DSTC_wikipedia] (DSTC), a part government, part commercial
Cooperative Research Centre, which operated from 1992 until mid
2006. Elvin was rapidly picked up by internal DSTC projects and by
several of DSTC's partners, such as the [Australian Defence Science
and Technology Organisation][DSTO] (DSTO), due to its ability to
provide a highly reliable, fast, wide-area communication bus.

Mantara Software was created as a DSTC spin-off commercial entity in
2003 in order to further develop and market Elvin as a supported
product. When Mantara announced it would stop offering Elvin as a
standalone supported product, Matthew Phillips began to implement the
Elvin open specifications published at [elvin.org][] as part of the
Open Source Avis project.

The Avis project's goal is to enable stakeholders to continue
developing systems using the proven Elvin message bus technology. It
is intended that the Avis project will track developments in Elvin to
remain a compatible long-term option.
