About Avis
======================================================================

Avis is an event router service compatible with the commercial Elvin
implementation developed by Mantara Software. Avis provides a
general-purpose, fast and scalable publish/subscribe message bus using
content-based subscriptions.

Elvin event routers enable arbitrary messages, known as notifications,
to be exchanged via a publish/subscribe model. Elvin clients subscribe
to messages using expressions that match messages by their content, an
approach that differs from many other message bus systems that operate
by selecting messages published on pre-defined channels. This promotes
an even higher level of decoupling between producers and consumers of
events.
