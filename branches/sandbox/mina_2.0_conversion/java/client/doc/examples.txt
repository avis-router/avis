Avis Client Library Examples
======================================================================

Examples of using the Avis client library can be found in
"src/examples".


Running The Examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------

These examples can all be run from Ant via the tasks with "example-"
as their prefix. Run "ant -projecthelp" to see the available example
tasks.

You will need an Elvin router to run any of these examples -- you can
either install the Avis router (or other compatible Elvin router), or
use the public Elvin router at elvin://public.elvin.org.

To run an example from the console:

  > ant example-helloworld

or, if you aren't using a local router (i.e. elvin://localhost):

  > ant example-helloworld -Delvin=elvin://public.elvin.org


Looking Under The Hood
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In each example, an "ec" (Elvin Consumer) command is given that will
show the Elvin messages being sent. The ec command can be found in the
"bin" directory and is a useful way of dumping Elvin messages to the
console for debugging or recording purposes.

Try running ec in a separate console while running the examples.


Hello World
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates two Elvin connections in one application,
one sending the traditional "Hello World" message as a greeting, the
other one listening for all greetings and printing them to the
console.

It also demonstrates an easy way to have one thread wait for another
to receive a message. 

command: ant example-helloworld

ec command: ec -e elvin://localhost "require (Greeting)"


Wall Broadcaster & Wall Receiver
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example uses two console applications to simulate a simple Unix
"wall"-style command that broadcasts text to a number of consoles.

Start one or more Wall Receiver instances in one console each, and
then run a Wall Broadcaster in another console.

For example:

  Console 1:
  > ant example-wall-receiver

  Console 2:
  > ant example-wall-receiver

  Console 3:
  > ant example-wall-broadcaster

Now type some text into Console 3 (you may need to press Enter to make
it send) and see it sent to the two receivers. Try running more
broadcasters and receivers.

ec command: ec -e elvin://localhost "From == 'wall'"


Secure Sender & Secure Receiver
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we set up a situation where a sender wants to ensure
that only receivers it trusts can see its messages. To ensure
security:

  * The sender and receiver(s) agree on a secret password and security
    scheme (SHA-1 Consumer).

  * The sender uses the public version of the key on notifications.

  * Receivers use the private version of the key on their
    subscriptions.

See the documentation attached to the Avis KeyScheme class for more
details on how security schemes work.

Example usage:

  Console 1:
  > ant example-secure-receiver
  ...
  > Enter the password for receiving: password
  > Listening for messages...

  Console 2:
  > ant example-secure-sender
  ...
  > Enter the password for sending: password
  > Enter the text to send: Hello (secure) world
  > Message sent!

You should see the message text from Console 2 appear on Console 1. If
you run the command again in Console 2, but use a different password,
you will see that the Console 1 client will no longer be able to
receive it.

ec command: for this example you need to provide ec with the security
key needed to receive the secure messages sent between the two
clients. ec expects keys to be stored in key files, so create a file
named "password.key" containing the single line:

  "password"

Then run ec as below:

  > ec -e elvin://localhost -C password.key "From == 'secure-sender'"
