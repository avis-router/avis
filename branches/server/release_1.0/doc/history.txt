Release 1.0 (March 24, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release focus: provide a baseline stable release with full Elvin 4.0
compatibility for subsets A & B of the protocol (i.e. minus quench).

Change summary:

* Added RPM distribution.

* Updated to Apache MINA 1.0.2.

* The number of socket IO threads is now set to the number of
  available CPU's + 1.

* Expanded website, including an installation guide.

* Source code cleanups and re-organisation.

* Quench requests are now vetoed with the NOT_IMPL error code.

* Updated connection options to match Elvin 4.0 spec changes.


 Release 0.7 (December 27, 2006)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release focus: improve ease of router installation and
configuration. Added installers/packages for Mac OS X, Fedora Core and
Windows. Router now supports configuration options via -c switch.

Change summary:

 * Upgraded to Apache MINA 1.0.1.

 * Quench requests now generate (non-standard) 2299 NACK code to avoid
   making clients think they've triggered a protocol violation. This
   results in better behaviour when using quench from je4.

 * Added support for configuring server using configuration file with
   -c option.

 * Added Unix-specific options -pidfile, -logfile and -daemon to
   bin/avisd.sh.

 * Client connection options are now case-independent.

 * Added packaging wrappers for Mac OS X, Fedora Core (should be
   fairly straightforward to port to other *nix) and Windows.


Release 0.6 (December 3, 2006)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release focus: improve server's ability to handle misbehaved/malicious
clients.

Change summary:

 * Fixed error in buffer-limiting code which caused errors for large
   packets.

 * Added input queue bandwidth throttling to enforce
   Receive-Queue.Max-Length. This should go a long way towards
   protecting server from being swamped by noisy clients.

 * Added various malicious client tests to observer server's response
   to high loads, large frames and deliberate attempts to exhaust
   resources.

 * Some attack windows reduced by implementing limits for
   Subscription.Max-Count, Subscription.Max-Length,
   Connection.Max-Keys and Subscription.Max-Keys. Still lots of work
   to do here though: for example client can still trigger server to
   run out of heap using lots of subscriptions of
   Subscription.Max-Length.

 * Various extensions and fixes for SimpleClient used for testing.

 * Network.Coalesce-Delay option is now Transport.TCP.Coalesce-Delay.

 * Vendor ID is now sent with compatible name also.

 * Reduced verbosity of -v option.


Release 0.5 (November 20, 2006)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Public project info created: website and README.txt with
   instructions on how to get started.

 * Added enforcement for Packet.Max-Length connection option. Other
   (unsupported) size-related options changed so server doesn't lie if
   client cares about these.

 * Added handling for client protocol violations. All protocol
   violations now trigger session close with NACK if appropriate.

 * Ported from Apache MINA 0.8 API to Apache MINA 1.0 API.


Older releases
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* 0.4: Nov 5, 2006: First public release on sourceforge.net. Added
  concurrency support that ensures consistency when changing
  subscriptions/keys. Implemented initial connection options handling
  based on new spec, with compatibility support: options accepted but
  not implemented yet, all sizes are limited only by memory and no
  queue priority is available yet.

* 0.3: Oct 15, 2006: Implemented SHA-1 security schemes, unotify,
  quench placeholder.

* 0.2: Oct 2, 2006: Completed full subscription expression support.

* 0.1.2: Sep 30, 2006: fixed a few other minor bugs.

* 0.1.1: Sep 30, 2006: fixed threading bug.

* 0.1: Sep 30, 2006: first cut to David: no math ops in sub exprs,
  parser would not accept function names as fields, no security,
  unotify.

* Sep 11, 2006: Project started.
