Release 1.0 (June 24, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release marks the first baseline of the Java client API. The core
set of features required for an Elvin client library are now
implemented and stable, including subscription, notification,
security, close event notification, liveness checking and router
connection option support.

Still to come are SSL/TLS support and quench. A utility to add
auto-reconnect-on-close behaviour is also planned.

* Improved error messages for rejected requests from router.

* Added close event notification support. Clients can now listen for
  both client-initiated and router-initiated shutdowns.

* Added connection liveness checking using the TestConn message when
  connection is idle past a certain amount of time.

* ec and ep now accept multiple key formats via the -C and -P
  options. Now supports hex-coded, string and raw keys. sha1 now
  generates compatible hex-coded keys.

* ec now shows "[secure]" in the header of securely-received
  notifications.

* Simplified MINA I/O setup to use a single fixed codec factory.

* Many code cleanups and javadoc improvements.


Release 0.2 (June 11, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release contains many improvements and general solidification of
the API, including a few incompatible changes. Added programming
examples.

* Added example code in src/examples and instructions in
  doc/examples.txt.

* Converted to using new InvalidURIException for ElvinURI rather than
  checked URISyntaxException. This avoid irritation of having to
  declare this exception in any code that creates a URI.

* Added Elvin.closeOnExit ().

* Added new constructor to Elvin.

* Added Subscription.setSecureMode ().

* Added ec/ep tools to client distribution.

* Incompatible API change: Changed parameter order of secure mode/keys
  in Elvin and Subscription.

* Incompatible API change: Renamed
  Subscription.addNotificationListener () to addListener ()

* All arguments in Elvin, Subscription and Notification are now more
  thoroughly checked for null etc

* Fixed Elvin.unsubscribe (): was removing subscription before
  acknowledgement from router.

* Improved Notification.hashCode ().

* Client will now expand argument references (e.g. "%1") in Nack error
  messages generated by Mantara Elvin.

* New InvalidSubscriptionException is now thrown on subscription
  expression errors rather than a generic IOException.

* Added support for IPv6 addresses in Elvin URI's.


Release 0.1 (June 5, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release is to gain feedback on the API. There are still some
features missing, including auto reconnect, keepalive and router
notifications on connect/disconnect.
