 * Elvin defines two types of key, <em>private</em> (or <em>raw</em>)
 * keys, and <em>public</em> (or <em>prime</em>) keys. A public
 * key is a one-way hash (e.g. using SHA-1) of a private key. A
 * private key may be any random data, or simply a password. A private
 * key is defined to match a public key if the corresponding hash of
 * its data matches the public key's data, e.g. if
 * <code>sha1 (privateKey.data) == publicKey.data</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note that this is not a public key system in the RSA sense but
 * that, like RSA, public keys can be shared in the open without loss
 * of security.

 * <h3>Ownership</h3>
 *
 * Once added to a Keys collection, a Key's data is considered to
 * be owned by the key set and will be freed whent when elvin_keys_free()
 * is invoked. Thus, if you wish to add the same key more than once you
 * should elvin_key_copy() it first.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, once a Keys instance has been used in a successful call
 * to an Elvin client connection (e.g. elvin_open_with_keys() or
 * elvin_subscribe_with_keys()), the connection will take ownership of
 * that key collection and free it when appropriate.
 * <p>
 * Once in use, key collections should be treated as immutable
 * and never be modified directly.

/**
 * Defines an Elvin security scheme. A key scheme
 * defines a mode of sending or receiving notifications securely.
 *
 * <h3>The Producer Scheme</h3>
 *
 * In the producer scheme, consumers of notifications ensure that a
 * notification producer is known to them. The producer uses the
 * private key, and consumers use the public key. If the producer
 * keeps its private key secure, consumers can be assured they are
 * receiving notifications from a trusted producer.
 *
 * <h3>The Consumer Scheme</h3>
 *
 * In the consumer scheme, producers of notifications ensure that a
 * notification consumer is known to them, i.e. the producer controls
 * who can receive its notifications. In this scheme -- the reverse of
 * the producer scheme -- the consumer uses the private key, and
 * producers use the public key. If the consumer keeps its private key
 * secure, then the producer can be assured that only the trusted
 * consumer can receive its notifications.
 *
 * <h3>The Dual Scheme</h3>
 *
 * The dual scheme combines both the producer and consumer schemes, so
 * that both ends can send and receive securely. Typically both ends
 * exchange public keys, and each end then emits notifications with
 * both its private key and the public key(s) of its intended
 * consumer(s) attached. Similarly, each end would subscribe using its
 * private key and the public key(s) of its intended producer(s).
 *
 * <h3>Supported Schemes</h3>
 *
 * Avis currently supports just the SHA-1 secure hash as defined in
 * version 4.0 of the Elvin protocol. As such, three schemes are
 * available: KEY_SCHEME_SHA1_DUAL, KEY_SCHEME_SHA1_CONSUMER and
 * KEY_SCHEME_SHA1_PRODUCER.
