Todo
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * DONE: Handle TLS connect failure better
 * DONE: client options to subsume constructor options
 * DONE: client auth split into clients and federators
 * DONE hostname matching in fed should be case-insenstive (do we support IP
   addresses?)
* DONE: add example code to web site: syntax highlighting
* DONE: think about putting expected reply type in XID messages: would
  remove need for param in sendAndReceive ().
* DONE: Key I/O
* DONE: re org into client, server and common projects?
* DONE: fix bogus generics in AST nodes: do not compile with javac
* DONE: we allow unsubscribe from notification: should resolve sub
  ID's to objects before firing event.
* WONT DO: could use fast collection for client subscription map
* DONE: keepalives? connection test

* DONE: write a multi-threaded test thrasher to try to crash server
* DONE: increase Packet.Max-Length
* DONE: Unicode decompose on 1.6
* DONE: require(e) vs. require (e). Mantara accepts both, we don't do first
  one any more.
* DONE: Update MINA: some tests fail 1.1.2
* DONE: java.io.IOException: Connection reset by peer: do not log IO errors
  as alarms?
* DONE: write multithreaded "fuzz" test: fire random messages
* DONE: how do we handle other langs in SVN? do we need to? e.g. should
  Python binding be a separate project?
* DONE: sub expr error reporting as in sec 6.3 and 7.4.2 (NACK codes)
* DONE: constant pool for Const?
* DONE: connection options
* DONE: check client version numbers
* DONE: ec/ep
* DONE: Klaus: add interface selection
* DONE: Ian's suggestions + diagrams
* DONE: web site PR: why use Avis? examples see why.txt
* DONE: pkg permissions
* DONE: case-independent options
* DONE: full test with Sticker
* DONE: need separate VM's for MaliciousClient test
* DONE: roadmap. ewafd-equivalent. built in?
* DONE: no. do we need SSL/TLS in 1.0?
* DONE: add Unix and windows service wrappers and installers
* DONE: add basic settings to become net ready: limit connection counts,
  subs, bandwidth etc to avoid DOS attacks possible to OOM the server by
  flooding it with fairly large packets.
* DONE: basic enforcment of connection options
* DONE: test performance after MINA 1.0 port. seems to be slower on
  test_threaded_clients (old 6s, new 12s)
* DONE: consistency: use multi-reader setup for changes to ensure
  e.g. a notification not delivered for an old sub already ack'ed.
* DONE: port to MINA 1.0.0. total API change, no porting guide?!
  IoSession seems to replace ProtocolSession. see
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/directory/trunks/mina/example/src/main/java/org/apache/mina/example/sumup/
* DONE: Java 1.6 doesn't have DECOMPOSE. Will break if used on 1.6,
  won't compile on 1.6.


Federation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* DONE: test @.elvin.org
* DONE: Enforce connection options frame size on federated notifications
* DONE: Stricter sanity checking for domain 
* DONE: check TODO's
* DONE: Clean up log messages

--

* DONE: Liveness checking with TestConn. Federation.Keepalive-Interval=60
* DONE: Apply-Class can only affect one router
* DONE: Default federation class? not
* DONE: Add-Attribute
* DONE: Do we want to use better config file parser? Need to resolve use if ":"
* DONE: Will probably encounter FedSubDiff from 4.4: may need to rev-engineer

# federation no

################################################################
# federation.name
#
# Default: <automatic>
# 
# The name the router will use for wide area federation. This name
# MUST be globally unique (we strongly recommend your host name from

# is provided, elvind will attempt to determine a unique name for
# itself.

################################################################
# federation.class.require
#
# Default: <none>
#
# The router may require federation links to be active in specific
# link classes before allowing clients to connect.  If at any time

# class then any existing clients will be disconnected and no new
# clients accepted until all required link classes have at least one
# connected link.

# federation.class.require internal

################################################################
# federation.identify.address
# federation.identify.domain
# federation.identify.id
#
# Default: <none>
#
# Restrict the machines that may connect to us with this class of
# federation link.  This serves to identify incoming federation links
# and assign them to classes.

################################################################
# federation.subscribe
#
# Default: <none>
#
# Specifies the notifications we are willing to receive from the other

################################################################
# federation.keepalive.period
#
# Default: 2 minutes
#
# The frequency with which to test each federation connection.
# 
# federation.keepalive.period 2m

################################################################
# federation.keepalive.timeout
#
# Default: 20 seconds
#
# The maximum length of time to wait for a response to a test before
# declaring the link dead.

# federation.keepalive.timeout 20s

################################################################
# federation.propagation.interval
#
# Default: off
#
# The minimum length of time between receiving acknowledgement of one
# subscription update and sending the next. If set to zero, subsequent
# subscription updates will be propagated immediately, even before the
# previous update has been acknowledged. If updates have to be delayed
# then after the propagation interval has expired the entire
# subscription database will be re-sent, not just the changes.
# 
# federation.propagation.interval 500ms

Notes
----
* JUTestServerAttack: Client can exhaust default server heap with
  2K max-sub-count x 3K max-sub-length
* Using fastutil increased server JAR from 334K to 446K.

Issues for David

* DONE: What is new router.coalesce-delay?
* DONE: Can I put je4 in distro? don't need it
* DONE:elvind does not do byte_size_max
* DONE:what is QosRqst? mentioned in 7.5 for changing options
