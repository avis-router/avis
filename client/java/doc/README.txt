Avis Client Library
======================================================================

The Avis client library is a Java 5 API for accessing Elvin event
routers. This includes the Avis event router and the Mantara Elvin
product.

If you're not sure where to get started, have a look at the example
code in client/examples and the associated documentation in
doc/examples.txt. The API documentation is in client/javadoc.

The Avis web site is http://avis.sourceforge.net.

Using In Eclipse
======================================================================

To add the Avis client library to your project:
 
 * Right click your project -> choose Properties.

 * Select "Java Build Path".

 * Select the "Libraries" tab at the top.

 * Choose "Add Jars..." and select "client/java/lib/avis-client.jar"
   from the Avis client distribution. Or copy the JAR file beforehand
   into your project and select that.

 * Expand the new avis-client.jar entry, select "Source attachment" ->
   "Edit..."

 * Select "External folder..." and choose "client/java/src/main" from
   the Avis distribution.

This will add the JAR file and connect the source code to it for
browsing purposes.


Building Avis
================================================================================

NOTE: The client library distribution does not include the avis.server
component which is needed to build and run the tests. You can modify
and build the avis-client.jar from source with Ant using this
distribution, but you will not be able to run tests or build a full
distribution.

If you want to change anything significant in the Avis client library
it is recommended that you get the source code via Subversion from
either a release branch, e.g.

 * https://avis.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/avis/branches/client/release_1.0

or the development branch at

 * https://avis.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/avis/trunk

Patches are welcome, and should be sent to the project maintainer.


Building (Ant 1.6 or later)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Avis client library comes pre-built in the client/lib directory of
this distribution. If you wish to modify the library, you may re-build
it as below:

  > cd avis-client-1.0.0/client/java
  > ant

To see all build targets:

  > ant -projecthelp


Building (Eclipse 3.2 or later)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[this will only work with the full source tree from Subversion: see
note above]

From Eclipse:

  * Select File -> Import...

  * Select "Existing Projects Into Workspace..."

  * Select the root of the Avis client library e.g. avis-client-1.0.0.

  * The projects avis.common, avis.client and avis.server should be
    found: select all three.

You can add the client/build.xml file to the Eclipse Ant view to
access Ant build targets from the IDE.
