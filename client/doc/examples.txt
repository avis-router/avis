For examples of using the Avis client library please see the source
code in "src/examples".

These can all be run from Ant via the tasks with "example-" as their
prefix. Run "ant -projecthelp" to see the available example tasks.


Running The Examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need an Elvin router -- you can either install the Avis
router (or other compatible Elvin router) locally, or use the public
Elvin router at public.elvin.org.

To run an example from the console:

  > ant example-helloworld

or, if you aren't using a local router (i.e. elvin://localhost):
  
  > ant example-helloworld -Delvin=elvin://public.elvin.org


Looking Under The Hood
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In each example, an "ec" command is given that will show the Elvin
messages being sent. The ec command can be found in the "bin"
directory and is a useful way of dumping Elvin messages to the console
for debugging or recording puposes.

Try running this command in a separate console while running the
examples.


HelloWorld
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates two Elvin connections in one application,
one sending the traditional "Hello World" message as a greeting, the
other one listening for all greetings and printing them to the
console.

It also demonstrates an easy way to have one thread wait for another
to receive a message. 

ec command: ec -e elvin://localhost "require (Greeting)"


WallBroadcaster and WallReceiver
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example uses two console applications to simulate a simple Unix
"wall" command that broadcasts text to a number of consoles.

Start one or more WallReceiver instances in one console each, and then
run WallBroadcaster in another console.

For example:

  Console 1:
  > ant example-wall-receiver

  Console 2:
  > ant example-wall-receiver

  Console 3:
  > ant example-wall-broadcaster

Now type some text into Console 3 (you may need to press Enter to make
it send) and see it sent to the two receivers. Try running more
broadcasters and receivers.

ec command: ec -e elvin://localhost "From == 'wall'"
