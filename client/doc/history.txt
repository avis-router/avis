Release 0.2 (June 11, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release contains many improvements and general solidification of
the API, including a few incompatible changes. Added programming
examples.

* Added example code in src/examples and instructions in
  doc/examples.txt.

* Converted to using new InvalidURIException for ElvinURI rather than
  checked URISyntaxException. This avoid irritation of having to
  declare this exception in any code that creates a URI.

* Added Elvin.closeOnExit ().

* Added new constructor to Elvin.

* Added Subscription.setSecureMode ().

* Added ec/ep tools to client distribution.

* Incompatible API change: Changed parameter order of secure mode/keys
  in Elvin and Subscription.

* Incompatible API change: Renamed
  Subscription.addNotificationListener () to addListener ()

* All arguments in Elvin, Subscription and Notification are now more
  thoroughly checked for null etc

* Fixed Elvin.unsubscribe (): was removing subscription before
  acknowledgement from router.

* Improved Notification.hashCode ().

* Client will now expand argument references (e.g. "%1") in Nack error
  messages generated by Mantara Elvin.

* New InvalidSubscriptionException is now thrown on subscription
  expression errors rather than a generic IOException.


Release 0.1 (June 5, 2007)
