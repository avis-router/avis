Release 1.1.0 (January 21, 2008)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release adds support for secure connections to the router using
TLS/SSL. It also includes a variety of improvements to the client API
and distribution.

 * The client can now encrypt and authenticate connections with the
   router over secure URI's ("elvin:/secure/...").

 * Added support for TLS/SSL to ec and ep.

 * Client configuration options are now specified using an extensible
   ElvinOptions class. The existing constructors now operate by
   creating an instance of ElvinOptions and initialising it
   appropriately.

 * Non fatal errors and warnings detected by the client connection are
   now emitted through a new ElvinLogListener interface, or logged to
   the console. This removes the need for clients to use the Avis Log
   API, which is not intended to be public.

 * The connection to the router is now closed when any sort of
   protocol violation is detected, even if the client could possibly
   recover. This is a safer option than continuing with a possibly
   broken router.

 * Added REASON_IO_ERROR error code to CloseEvent.

 * Added utilities to escape strings for use in subscription
   expressions to the Subscription class.

 * Source code for the router is now included with the client source
   distribution, allowing it build and test inside Eclipse.

 * Simplified example code.
 
 * ep now correctly terminates when used with console input.

 * Improved error message that occurs when using an unresolvable host
   name in a URI.


Release 1.0.6 (November 23, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release improves compatibility with older Mantara routers.

 * Connection options are now sent with their legacy counterparts so
   that older Mantara routers can process them. In the previous client
   library release, specifying a new connection option that the
   Mantara router did not understand, such as TCP.Send-Immediately,
   would cause a connection failure.

 * Subscription.remove () may now be called for subscriptions on a
   closed connection without generating an error.

 * Updated to the latest MINA 1.1.4 release.


Release 1.0.5 (November 3, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release fixes an error that would cause the client to temporarily
stall in some situations while waiting for queued callbacks to
complete.

 * Callbacks are now flushed by invoking them from the current thread
   rather than waiting for the callback thread (which may end up
   waiting on the current thread if it holds the client
   mutex). Callback flushing typically occurs during calls such as
   Subscription.remove (), Elvin.setKeys (), Elvin.close (), etc to
   ensure that queued callbacks related to a removed subscription or
   keyset are not delivered after the subscription has been removed.


Release 1.0.4 (October 27, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release fixes a number of errors that have been identified when
sharing a single connection between multiple threads.

 * The fix applied in 1.0.3 for the "invalid subscription ID" warning
   was not sufficient. A more robust technique has been implemented.

 * The client's close () method could block and raise several errors
   when under load.

 * The use of Thread.interrupt () to terminate client threads could
   put the client in an inconsistent state.

 * The test suite has been improved to add tests for robustness when
   used from multi-threaded clients.


Release 1.0.3 (October 20, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release fixes three errors and adds a number of small
improvements to the API.

 * Under heavy load, a race condition in subscribe and unsubscribe was
   resulting in "invalid subscription ID" log warnings.

 * The TCP.Send-Immediately setting, which can be used to disable TCP
   buffering, was not being honoured by the client.

 * The Elvin constructor was erroneously declaring it throws the
   checked URISyntaxException rather than the unchecked
   InvalidURIException that is actually thrown when the URI is
   invalid.

 * Queued callbacks (e.g. for notifications) are now flushed so
   clients will not see notifications for a subscription after a
   remove (), setKeys (), etc. method returns.

 * Improved ConnectionOptions API.

 * NotConnectedException (a subclass of IOException) is now thrown
   when an attempt to use a closed connection is detected.

 * Added setAll () to Notification.


Release 1.0.2 (September 1, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release corrects a packaging error in the previous release that
resulted in two required classes not being included in the pre-built
JAR. It also synchronises the client library's common shared
components with those of Avis 1.1.

  * Fixed creation of avis-client.jar: was missing listener classes
    such as NotificationListener.

  * avis-tools.jar no longer includes all classes: now uses
    avis-client.jar.

  * avis.common code library is now updated to be the same as released
    in Avis 1.1. This introduces minor changes the API of some
    packages in avis.common, however clients using this package should
    not be relying on these classes in any case: only classes included
    in the javadoc API are considered part of the client API.


Release 1.0.1 (August 14, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release corrects an error in the client's communications with the
router and adds a number of smaller improvements.

 * The client was not calculating the length of strings with
   multi-byte UTF-8 characters correctly, which would cause a protocol
   violation and disconnection.

 * The client's handling protocol violations and other errors has been
   improved.

 * A bug in the client's handling of a close () call from a callback
   has been corrected.


Release 1.0 (June 24, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release marks the first baseline of the Java client API. The core
set of features required for an Elvin client library are now
implemented and stable, including subscription, notification,
security, close event notification, liveness checking and router
connection option support.

Still to come are SSL/TLS support and quench. A utility to add
auto-reconnect-on-close behaviour is also planned.

* Improved error messages for rejected requests from router.

* Added close event notification support. Clients can now listen for
  both client-initiated and router-initiated shutdowns.

* Added connection liveness checking using the TestConn message when
  connection is idle past a certain amount of time.

* ec and ep now accept multiple key formats via the -C and -P
  options. Now supports hex-coded, string and raw keys. sha1 now
  generates compatible hex-coded keys.

* ec now shows "[secure]" in the header of securely-received
  notifications.

* Simplified MINA I/O setup to use a single fixed codec factory.

* Many code cleanups and javadoc improvements.


Release 0.2 (June 11, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release contains many improvements and general solidification of
the API, including a few incompatible changes. Added programming
examples.

* Added example code in src/examples and instructions in
  doc/examples.txt.

* Converted to using new InvalidURIException for ElvinURI rather than
  checked URISyntaxException. This avoid irritation of having to
  declare this exception in any code that creates a URI.

* Added Elvin.closeOnExit ().

* Added new constructor to Elvin.

* Added Subscription.setSecureMode ().

* Added ec/ep tools to client distribution.

* Incompatible API change: Changed parameter order of secure mode/keys
  in Elvin and Subscription.

* Incompatible API change: Renamed
  Subscription.addNotificationListener () to addListener ()

* All arguments in Elvin, Subscription and Notification are now more
  thoroughly checked for null etc

* Fixed Elvin.unsubscribe (): was removing subscription before
  acknowledgement from router.

* Improved Notification.hashCode ().

* Client will now expand argument references (e.g. "%1") in Nack error
  messages generated by Mantara Elvin.

* New InvalidSubscriptionException is now thrown on subscription
  expression errors rather than a generic IOException.

* Added support for IPv6 addresses in Elvin URI's.


Release 0.1 (June 5, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release is to gain feedback on the API. There are still some
features missing, including auto reconnect, keepalive and router
notifications on connect/disconnect.
