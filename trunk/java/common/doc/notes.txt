Releases
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Server 1.3

* BUG: slow big frames https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRMINA-609.
* add note about windows registry Java currentversion = 1.6 when 1.5
  installed.
* router src distro needs ec/ep
* add log filter option to show notifs rather than trace. would need
  custom log filter levels.

Server 1.2

 * DONE: add Unix basic distro
 * DONE: print full version on console
 * DONE: review todo's
 * DONE: fix Vendor-Identification
 * DONE: if we package a known key in router keystore, does this make TLS
   pointless?
 * DONE: package tools with server
 * DONE: Change Unix layout to match http://cvs.openpkg.org/fileview?f=openpkg-src/avis/avis.spec
 * DONE: switch to launchd for OS X http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html
  (10.4 only, but Java 5 only works there anyway). Put in 
  /Library/LaunchDaemons/. Look at 
  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist. Also log to /var/log/avis 
 * DONE: dump notifications in -vv mode
 * DONE: date in log messages: Dec 23 04:20:01
 * DONE: TLS web page
 * DONE: how do we map fed classes to only trusted clients?
 * DONE: Support client auth in connect/listen
   options. elvin:/secure/0.0.0.0:29170?require-trusted=true. put
   options in as default layer in front of config.
 * DONE: test add keystore to distro
 * DONE: ditch use of @ in federation. use of server domain is fairly useless
 * DONE: allow wildcards in federation
 * DONE: --Liveness TestConn for client connections?
 * DONE: do we allow no keystore? 
 * DONE--: change default federation class syntax?
   e.g. Federation.Apply-Class[Public]=*
 * DONE: Federation TLS
 * DONE: Ship Avis server with default certs?

Client 1.1

 * DONE: simplify examples
 * DONE: client source won't build in Eclipse without server. Need to add it
   or deal with it otherwise.
 * DONE: review todo's
 * DONE: client should not log messages: events instead, esp
   DropWarn. Will need a way to send these to log for testing.
 * DONE: ec/ep options for TLS
 * NOT DONE: ep needs to handle empty lines 
 * DONE: --allow connection options in URI. merge with given options? --use
   server options package and ditch special options class?--
 * DONE: TLS
 * DONE: add subscription string escape utilities
 * DONE: ep doesn't do ^D properly

Not allocated
--------------

Client

* handle redirect disconns 
* synchronous reconnect/redirect? block for up to x secs before closing
* better reporting for going over connection limits (e.g. max subs)
* UDP unotify
* auto connect/reconnect
* lots of ec/ep options
* discovery
* async/future-based messaging in client. use futures to track responses.
* BUG: ec hangs on Presence-Protocol from public.elvin.org. Takes a long time
  to close connection. possibly related to use of "tee" on command line
* MAYBE: replace IOException witn RuntimeIOException? relates/affected
  by async idea

Server

* allow some federation links to be required before router goes
  online. means clients don't think they're connected to the world
  when they're in a ghetto.
* ?do we want clients trusted by CA's to be trusted
* Test large frames with new heap sizes
* ?thread pool size option
* Password auth? Could use a KeyManager to use password auth? Not sure
  how X509KeyManager can be extended to do this. There may be an Elvin
  spec for this.
* windows JRE does not have -server, need to add installer option
* includes in config: would allow federation to be spec'd separately
* Federation.Classes.Require=internal
* failure to find VM wrapper on windows (David). possibly due to 
  uninstalling Java 5 after installing Java 6
* Mantara ec requires elvin:4.0//...
* Warning: Failed to cleanly shut down thread pool. avisd during
  testing for Alain. Also seen in FOCAL, possibly related to
  federation reconnection. Not due to connected clients. Perhaps due
  to waiting for Disconn to be sent?
* simple web-based stats: use small HTTP server.
* web-based management: use small HTTP server. or in context of
  OSGi. allow shutdown-and-redirect
* DEB, Solaris: look at je4 packages dir
* what happens when sending ntfn to client that's too big?
* test SecRqst: test_sync_modify_keys fails (should NACK empty keys)
* profile performance
* partly done: router-wide options that allow client to grow connection
  footprint such like as keys, subscriptions. client can still easily kill
  server using long subs atm. keys attack window reduced but still may be
  possible using sub/ntfn keys plus long keys. need to check max size of key
  data.
* add message logging via MINA filter, remove current crusty approach
* notification dropping incl DropWarn
* write a multi-threaded test thrasher to test consistency
* look into whether server can store hashed keys only and avoid
  hashing them on each match. See Connection.matchSubscriptions ()
* DONE: OS X: installation in /usr/local means getting blown away on system
  reinstall. should we go in /opt?

SSL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenarios

 * Client connects to elvin:/secure/public.elvin.org, wants auth and
   privacy. Enable server auth on client, server has cert from root
   CA. Add optional server auth required option for client, plus
   optional trust keystore. Extend null trust manager as per
   example. Will need to add new Elvin constructor taking client
   options and absorb keys, etc into it. Server can have optional
   client auth

Todo

 * DONE: Avis client lib TLS
 * DONE: Create client/server certs, test mutual auth
 * DONE: Use separate keystore for trusted certs?
  
Questions

 * CLOSED: Do we need to support trusted clients? => need trust store
   on server, key store on client, enable client auth on server.

 * CLOSED: Do we want security per-URI?

 * CLOSED: Do we need to support trusted servers? => need trust store
   on client, enable server auth on client

 * CLOSED: Federation TLS: security per class?

 * CLOSED: Enable remote auth with URI option?
   elvin:/secure/host?Remote-Auth=true. probably not: options are
   connection options, not client config.

 * CLOSED: Do we want to support keystores other than JKS?
   eg. PKCS12. Check we could just import PKCS12, and add instructions
   if so.

 * CLOSED: Client -> trust: could implement trust manager: see
   "Creating Your Own X509TrustManager"
