About Avis
======================================================================

Avis is a high-performance event router. It provides a fast
publish/subscribe event routing service compatible with the commercial
Elvin implementation developed by [Mantara Software][mantara].

Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Fast broadcast message delivery. No requirement to support
   transactions or persistence, plus concise message selection allows
   near real-time delivery.

 * Flexible message format. Messages are just name-value pairs.

 * [Content-based subscription][sub_expr]. Select messages using
   subscription expressions like `From == 'logger' && Severity > 3` or
   `(string (Message) && Timeout > 0) || regex (Message, 'News:.*')`.

 * [Federation of multiple message routers][federation]. Replicate
   selected messages between any configuration of routers to form
   local and wide-area message networks.

 * Security. Supports per-subscription access control and [SSL/TLS
   client/server authentication and encryption][tls].

 * Simplicity. No external dependencies and no configuration
   required. Avis runs on any platform that supports Java 5 or later.

 * [Client libraries][client] for Java and C. Write Avis clients for a
   wide variety of platforms.

[examples][] page demonstrates a simple usage scenario.


Existing Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Current uses for Elvin routers include providing a message bus for
[instant messaging and presence][tickertape.org], device discovery and
coordination for [Livespace smart meeting rooms][livespaces], and as a
carrier of [distributed speech transcription for meetings][AuTM]. The
commercial implementation developed by Mantara has been used
extensively for high-volume real-time financial transaction routing.


Current Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Avis is a compatible drop-in replacement for Mantara's commercial
`elvind` if quenching (for discovery of subscriptions) is not
required. Avis also supports [federation][] with other
Elvin-compatible routers.

See the [roadmap page][roadmap] for more information on what's planned
for Avis.


History
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elvin orginated as a project at the [Distributed Systems Technology
Centre][DSTC_wikipedia] (DSTC), a Cooperative Research Centre, which
operated from 1992 until mid 2006. During this time Elvin was
incorporated into a number of DSTC projects and adopted by several of
DSTC's partners, such as the [Australian Defence Science and
Technology Organisation][DSTO] (DSTO).

In 2003 Mantara Software Inc was created as a DSTC spin-off commercial
entity in order to further develop and market Elvin. When Mantara
announced it would stop offering Elvin as a stand-alone product,
Matthew Phillips implemented the Elvin open specifications published
at [elvin.org][] as free software in the form of the Avis project.

The Avis project aims to support ongoing development using the proven
Elvin message bus approach. It is intended that Avis will track
developments in the Elvin specifications in order to remain a
compatible long-term option.

The name "Avis" derives from the French word *avis*, meaning *advice*
or *notification*.
