Avis Client Libraries
======================================================================

The Avis project provides client libaries for development of
applications that wish to interact with an Elvin router. There are
currently libraries for Java and C, both available under the terms of
the [LGPL version 3][LGPL].

Java Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Avis Java Client Library provides a high level API to support Java
clients communicating with any Elvin-compatible router (including, of
course, Avis).

 * **[Download the Java client library][java-client-src]** (latest
   stable version ${java-client.version}: see the [Sourceforge
   download page][client-all] for older releases).

 * Online [Javadoc API documentation][java-apidoc] for the latest
   version of the library.

### Examples

The Java client library package contains a number of programming
examples in `src/examples` and documentation on how to use them in
`doc/examples.txt`. The examples are:

  * [HelloWorld.java](client-library/java/examples/HelloWorld.java.html). A
    single class creates two Elvin client connections, one sending the
    traditional "Hello World" message as a greeting, the other one
    listening for all greetings and printing them to the console.

  * [WallBroadcaster.java](client-library/java/examples/WallBroadcaster.java.html)
    and
    [WallReceiver.java](client-library/java/examples/WallReceiver.java.html). This
    example uses two console applications to simulate a simple Unix
    "wall"-style command that broadcasts text to a number of consoles.

  * [SecureSender.java](client-library/java/examples/SecureSender.java.html)
    and
    [SecureReceiver.java](client-library/java/examples/SecureReceiver.java.html). In
    this example we set up a situation where a sender wants to ensure
    that only receivers it trusts can see its messages.

You can also see a demonstration of the Java client library in a
realistic scenario at the [examples page][examples].

C Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Avis client library for C is a very small, portable C library for
accessing Elvin router services from native applications. It is
actively supported on Mac OS X (10.4 and 10.5), Linux (Fedora Core 3
and later), Solaris (5.9 and later), and Microsoft Windows (XP and
later).

 * **[Download the C client library source][c-client-src]** (release
   ${c-client.version}).

 * Download C client library binary (release ${c-client.version}):

   * **[Mac OS X framework (Universal)][c-client-bin-osx]**

   * **[Windows DLL (32 bit)][c-client-bin-win32]**

 * Online [C API documentation][c-apidoc] for the latest version of
   the library.

### Examples

The C client library package contains programming examples in
`src/examples`, including the traditional "Hello World":

  * [hello_world.c](client-library/c/examples/hello_world.c.html). A
    single applicatinon creates two Elvin client connections, one
    sending the traditional "Hello World" message as a greeting, the
    other one listening for greetings and printing them to the
    console.
