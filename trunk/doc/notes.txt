TODO

R1.1

* remove DSTO DFC log - use slf4j
* check client version numbers
* ec/ep
* DEB
* windows JRE does not have -server, need to add installer option
* thread pool size option?

Not allocated

* Klaus: add interface selection:
"""
However, looking through the API docs, it doesn't look hard to add.
Do you just want the ability to specify the interface(s) (e.g. "en1")
as part of the config?

It would help a lot to be able to choose a network interface.  It
could also be useful to be able to choose a hostname (understood as
"bind to every IP address associated with this hostname").  I'd
probably prefer the latter if I had to choose.
"""

* what happens when sending ntfn to client that's too big?
* sub expr error reporting as in sec 6.3 and 7.4.2 (NACK codes)
* test SecRqst: test_sync_modify_keys fails (should NACK empty keys)
* constant pool for Const?
* profile performance
* switch to launchd for OS X http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd
  (10.4 only, but Java 5 only works there anyway)
* partly done: router-wide options that allow client to grow connection
  footprint such like as keys, subscriptions. client can still easily kill
  server using long subs atm. keys attack window reduced but still may be
  possible using sub/ntfn keys plus long keys. need to check max size of key
  data.
* add message logging via MINA filter, remove current crusty approach
* notification dropping incl DropWarn
* write a multi-threaded test thrasher to test consistency
* write a multi-threaded test thrasher to try to crash server
* write multithreaded "fuzz" test: fire random messages

* DONE: Ian's suggestions + diagrams
* DONE: web site PR: why use Avis? examples see why.txt
* DONE: pkg permissions
* DONE: case-independent options
* DONE: full test with Sticker
* DONE: need separate VM's for MaliciousClient test
* DONE: roadmap. ewafd-equivalent. built in?
* DONE: no. do we need SSL/TLS in 1.0?
* how do we handle other langs in SVN? do we need to? e.g. should
  Python binding be a separate project?
* DONE: add Unix and windows service wrappers and installers
* DONE: add basic settings to become net ready: limit connection counts,
  subs, bandwidth etc to avoid DOS attacks possible to OOM the server by
  flooding it with fairly large packets.
* DONE: basic enforcment of connection options
* DONE: test performance after MINA 1.0 port. seems to be slower on
  test_threaded_clients (old 6s, new 12s)
* DONE: consistency: use multi-reader setup for changes to ensure
  e.g. a notification not delivered for an old sub already ack'ed.
* DONE: port to MINA 1.0.0. total API change, no porting guide?!
  IoSession seems to replace ProtocolSession. see
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/directory/trunks/mina/example/src/main/java/org/apache/mina/example/sumup/

Notes
----
* JUTestServerAttack: Client can exhaust default server heap with
  2K max-sub-count x 3K max-sub-length

Issues for David

* DONE: What is new router.coalesce-delay?
* DONE: Can I put je4 in distro? don't need it
* DONE:elvind does not do byte_size_max
* DONE:what is QosRqst? mentioned in 7.5 for changing options
