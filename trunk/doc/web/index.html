<h1>About Avis</h1>

<p>Avis is an event router service compatible with the commercial Elvin
implementation developed by Mantara Software. Avis provides a
general-purpose, scalable publish/subscribe message bus using
content-based subscriptions.</p>

<p>Elvin is a flexible event router that allows arbitrary messages
(a.k.a.  <em>notifications</em>) to be exchanged via a publish/subscribe
model. Elvin clients subscribe to messages using subscription
expressions that match messages by their content, an approach that
differs from most other message bus systems that operate by selecting
messages published on pre-defined channels. Elvin routers can also be
federated to construct high-efficiency, wide-area event networks.</p>

<p>The name "Avis" stems from the French word <em>avis</em>, meaning advice or
notification.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>Current uses for Elvin include <a href="http://tickertape.org">instant messaging and virtual
presence</a>, coordination for smart room control and
<a href="http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2595/">distributed speech transcription for meetings</a>. It has also
been used extensively by Mantara for high-volume financial transaction
routing.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>Avis is currently at a stage where it is usable as a drop-in
replacement for Mantara's <code>elvind</code> if quench and federation are not
required. A level of federation can currently be achieved by using
<code>ewafd</code>-style federation which essentially federates using a special
client to exchange notifications between servers.</p>

<p>Future development items include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A Java client library providing a similar capability to Mantara's
<code>je4</code> library. This will be released under the LGPL (Avis is GPL).</p></li>
<li><p>An <code>ewafd</code>-style federator to tide users over until real federation
is implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing the <em>quench</em> API for allowing producers to discover
what clients are listening for.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Elvin orginated at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Systems_Technology_Centre">Distributed Systems Technology
Centre</a>, a part government, part commercial
Cooperative Research Centre, which operated from 1992 until June,
2006. Elvin was rapidly picked up by DSTC groups and several of DSTC's
partners such as the <a href="http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au">Australian Defence Science and Technology
Organisation</a> (DSTO) due to its ability to provide a highly
reliable, fast, federated communication bus and became deployed in a
variety of contexts.</p>

<p>Mantara Software was spun off from DSTC as a commercial entity in 2003
to develop Elvin as a product. When Mantara announced it would stop
offering Elvin as a standalone product at the end of 2007, Matthew
Phillips, the author of Avis, began to implement the Elvin open
specifications at <a href="http://elvin.org">elvin.org</a> to allow DSTO and other interested
organisations to continue developing systems using the Elvin message
bus.</p>
