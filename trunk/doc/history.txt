Release 0.5 (November 20, 2006)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Public project info created: website and README.txt with
   instructions on how to get started.

 * Added enforcement for Packet.Max-Length connection option. Other
   (unsupported) size-related options changed so server doesn't lie if
   client cares about these.

 * Added handling for client protocol violations. All protocol
   violations now trigger session close with NACK if appropriate.

 * Ported from Apache MINA 0.8 API to Apache MINA 1.0 API.
