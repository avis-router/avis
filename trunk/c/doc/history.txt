----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release fixes a memory leak and adds a few minor features.

* Fixed minor memory leak in elvin_close ().

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release improves overall reliability.

* Added liveness checking to detect crashed router and low-level
  network failures.
