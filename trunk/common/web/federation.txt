Federation
======================================================================

Elvin routers can be federated together to form wide-area event
notification networks. A federated network of Elvin routers appears to
provide a single space of events to clients.

Federation Classes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To federate two routers you first need to decide which events to
exchange. For trusted routers this may be simply be all events,
however you will usually want to be specific as to what sorts of
events you want to accept and provide.

In Avis, a _federation class_ is used to specify events to import and
export using subscription expressions. For example, you might define a
`Public` federation class that allows [tickertape and
presence][tickertape] events in and out using:

<pre>
   <span class="variable-name">Federation.Subscribe</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = \
      Presence-Protocol == 1000 || string (Message)

   <span class="variable-name">Federation.Provide</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = \
      Distribution == "world" &amp;&amp; \
      (Presence-Protocol == 1000 || string (Message))
</pre>

This example class allows any tickertape or presence event into the
router, but only events with a `Distribution` field with the value
"world" to be federated outwards.

Connecting Routers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To connect two routers you need to decide which one initiates the
connection and which listens for connections. The router that
initiates the connection needs a line like:

<pre>
    <span class="variable-name">Federation.Connect</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = ewaf://public.elvin.org
</pre>

This specifies that the router should connect to `public.elvin.org`
using the `Public` federation class.

Incoming Connections
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The host that listens for incoming connections needs to have a mapping
for the remote host's federation ID or host name to a federation
class. For example, to specify that connections from the host
`public.elvin.org` should use the `Public` federation class:

<pre>
    <span class="variable-name">Federation.Apply-Class</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = @public.elvin.org
</pre>

And to set which address and port to listen to for incoming federation
connections:

<pre>
    <span class="variable-name">Federation.Listen</span> = ewaf://0.0.0.0:2916
</pre>

See the `etc/avisd.conf` file for more information on setting up
federation.
