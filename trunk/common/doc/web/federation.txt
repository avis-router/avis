Federation
======================================================================

Elvin routers can be federated together to form wide-area event
notification networks. A federated network of Elvin routers appears to
provide a single space of events to clients.

Federation Classes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To federate two routers you will first need to decide which events to
exchange. For trusted routers, this may be simply be all events,
however you will usually want to be specific as to what sorts of
events you want to accept and provide.

In Avis, a federation class is used to specify events to import and
export using subscription expressions. For example, you might define a
`Public` class that allows [tickertape and presence][tickertape]
events in and out using:

<pre>
   <span class="variable-name">Federation.Subscribe</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = \
      Presence-Protocol == 1000 || string (Message)

   <span class="variable-name">Federation.Provide</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = \
      Distribution == "world" && \
      (Presence-Protocol == 1000 || string (Message))
</pre>

This example class allows any tickertape or presence event into the
router, but only events with a `Distribution` field with the value
"world" to be federated outwards.


Allowing Incoming Connections
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To specify that connections from the host `host.somedomain.org` should
use the Public federation class:

<pre>
    <span class="variable-name">Federation.Apply-Class</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = @host.somedomain.org
</pre>

And finally, to set which address and port to listen to for incoming
federation connections:

<pre>
    <span class="variable-name">Federation.Listen</span> = ewaf://0.0.0.0:2916
</pre>

See the `etc/avisd.conf` file for more information on setting up
federation.
