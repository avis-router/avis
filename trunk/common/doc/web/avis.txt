About Avis
======================================================================

Avis provides a fast publish/subscribe event router service compatible
with the commercial Elvin implementation developed by [Mantara
Software][mantara].

Elvin event routers allow arbitrary messages, known as
*notifications*, to be exchanged via a publish/subscribe model &mdash;
Elvin clients subscribe to messages published by other clients using
pattern-matching expressions that select messages based on their
content. Multiple Elvin routers can be federated together to form
wide-area event notification networks.

The name "Avis" derives from the French word *avis*, meaning *advice*
or *notification*.


Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Current uses for Elvin include providing a wide-area message bus for
[instant messaging and presence][tickertape.org], device discovery and
coordination for smart meeting rooms, and as a carrier of [distributed
speech transcription for meetings][AuTM]. The commercial
implementation developed by Mantara has been used extensively for
high-volume financial transaction routing.

Elvin has been used in a wide variety of applications mainly due to
its lightweight nature and ability to be federated to form
internet-scale messaging networks. See [this page][why_avis] for more
discussion on why you might want to use it. The [examples][] page also
demonstrates in more detail a scenario in which it can be employed.


Current Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Avis is a compatible drop-in replacement for Mantara's commercial
`elvind` if quenching (for discovery of subscriptions) and federation
(for wide-area routing) are not required. Although Avis has not had
the extensive optimisation and tuning that Mantara's implementation
has, for most uses it will be fast enough for this not to be an issue.

See the [roadmap page][roadmap] for more information on what's planned
for Avis.


History
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elvin orginated as a project at the [Distributed Systems Technology
Centre][DSTC_wikipedia] (DSTC), a Cooperative Research Centre, which
operated from 1992 until mid 2006. During this time Elvin was
incorporated into a number of DSTC projects and adopted by several of
DSTC's partners, such as the [Australian Defence Science and
Technology Organisation][DSTO] (DSTO).

In 2003 Mantara Software Inc was created as a DSTC spin-off commercial
entity in order to further develop and market Elvin. When Mantara
announced it would stop offering Elvin as a supported product, Matthew
Phillips implemented the Elvin open specifications published at
[elvin.org][] as free software in the form of the Avis project.

The Avis project aims to support developing systems using the proven
Elvin message router approach. It is intended that Avis will track
developments in the Elvin specifications in order to remain a
compatible long-term option.
