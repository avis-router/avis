About Avis
======================================================================

Avis is an event router service compatible with the commercial Elvin
implementation developed by [Mantara Software][mantara]. Avis provides
a fast, general-purpose publish/subscribe message bus.

Elvin event routers allow arbitrary messages, known as
*notifications*, to be exchanged via a publish/subscribe model &mdash;
Elvin clients subscribe to messages published by other clients using
pattern-matching expressions that select messages by their
content. Multiple Elvin routers can be federated together to form
wide-area, lightweight event notification buses.

The name "Avis" derives from the French word *avis*, meaning advice or
notification.


Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Current uses for Elvin include providing a wide-area message bus for
[instant messaging and virtual presence][tickertape.org], device
coordination for smart meeting rooms and [distributed speech
transcription for meetings][AuTM]. The commercial implementation
developed by Mantara has been used extensively for high-volume
financial transaction routing.

Elvin has been picked up in many applications because of its
lightweight nature and flexibility: see [this page][why_avis] for more
discussion on why you might want to use it. The [examples][] page also
demonstrates in more detail a scenario in which it can be employed.


Current Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Avis can be used a compatible drop-in replacement for Mantara's
commercial `elvind` if quenching (for discovery of subscriptions) and
federation (for wide-area routing) are not required. Although Avis has
not had the extensive optimisation and tuning that Mantara's
implementation has, for most uses it has proven fast enough for this
not to be an issue.

See the [roadmap page][roadmap] for more information on what's planned
for Avis.


History
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elvin orginated as a project at the [Distributed Systems Technology
Centre][DSTC_wikipedia] (DSTC), a part government, part commercial
Cooperative Research Centre, which operated from 1992 until mid
2006. Elvin was incorporated into a number of DSTC projects and
adopted by several of DSTC's partners, such as the [Australian Defence
Science and Technology Organisation][DSTO] (DSTO), due to its ability
to provide a reliable, generic, and fast wide-area communication bus.

Mantara Software Inc was created as a DSTC spin-off commercial entity
in 2003 in order to further develop and market Elvin as a supported
product. When Mantara announced it would stop offering Elvin as a
standalone supported product, Matthew Phillips began to implement the
Elvin open specifications published at [elvin.org][] as part of the
Open Source Avis project.

The Avis project's goal is to enable users to continue developing
systems using the proven Elvin message bus technology. It is intended
that the Avis project will track developments in the Elvin
specifications to remain a compatible long-term option.
