Avis Client Library
======================================================================

The Avis Client Library is an API to aid Java clients in communicating
with an Elvin router. It is based on the same foundations as the Avis
router, but is made available under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 rather than the GPL used by
the router.

The client library package contains a number of programming examples
in `src/examples` and documentation on how to use them in
`doc/examples.txt`.

You can also see the example code in the <a
href="examples.html">examples page</a> which uses the client library
API.
