Using SSL/TLS
======================================================================

The Avis router has the option to use TLS (also known as SSL) to
authenticate and encrypt communications between the router and its
clients. You can use TLS to ensure only authorised clients and
federators are allowed to connect to the router, and to ensure that
eavesdroppers cannot intercept your traffic.

Setting Up TLS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest use of TLS is to encrypt communications between client
and router without requiring authentication. To set up this sort TLS,
you just need to specify it as a secure endpoint URI in the `Listen`
configuration option:

<pre>
<span class="variable-name">Listen</span> = elvin:/secure/0.0.0.0:29170
</pre>

This creates a TLS-secured endpoint on port 29170 ready for clients to
connect to. This sort of TLS does not provide any authentication
between the router and the client, but the TLS encryption it enables
greatly reduces the possibility of eavesdropping.

Using TLS Authentication
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to use TLS to strongly authenticate a router to a client
and/or the client to the router, you will need to create a private key
and associated public key certificate for each end that needs to be
authenticated.

For example, to authenticate a router to a client in order to give
assurance a client is connected to a trusted router over an insecure
network, the router needs a unique private key, and the client needs
to accept the associated public key as trusted.<sup>[1][]</sup> For
authenticating the client to the router the reverse applies: the
client needs a private key and the router must trust the accompanying
public key.

Generating A TLS Key
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To generate a key for use in Avis, you will need to use the [`keytool`
command][keytool] that ships with the Java Development Kit. The
`keytool` utility stores and retrieves keys and certificate chains in
a _keystore_, which is a binary archive, encrypted with a passphrase.

    > keytool -genkey -alias avis-router -keysize 512 \
       -validity 3650 -keyalg RSA \
       -dname "CN=Matthew Phillips, 
         OU=avis.sourceforge.net, \
         O=Avis Project, L=Adelaide, \
         S=South Australia, C=AU" \
       -keypass avis-router -storepass avis-router \
       -keystore avis-router.keystore

To list the keys in a keystore:

    > keytool -v -list -keystore avis-router.keystore \
        -storepass avis-router

    Keystore type: jks
    Keystore provider: SUN

Creating A Trust Relationship
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, generate a key for the router:

    > keytool -genkey -alias my-router-key -keysize 512 \
       -validity 3650 -keyalg RSA \
       -dname "CN=My Name, \
         OU=my.organisation.unit, \
         O=My Organisation, L=My Location, \
         S=My State, C=My Country Code" \
       -keypass mypassword -storepass mypassword \
       -keystore my-router.keystore

This creates a key called `my-router-key`<sup>[2][]</sup> in a
keystore called `my-router.keystore` (obviously you should replace the
"my-thing" placeholders with names appropriate to your usage).

Put the keystore in the same directory as the `avisd.config`
configuration file, and specify that Avis use it rather than the
default using these lines in the configuration:

<pre>
<span class="variable-name">TLS.Keystore</span> = my-router.keystore
<span class="variable-name">TLS.Keystore-Passphrase</span> = mypassword
</pre>

To export the public key to an X.509 certificate file:

    keytool -export -keystore my-router.keystore \
      -alias my-router-key -storepass mypassword \
      -file my-router.cer

To import the public key certificate into the client's keystore as a
trusted key:

    keytool -import -keystore my-client.keystore \
      -alias my-router-key -storepass mypassword \
      -file my-router.cer

Now, when the client connects to the router it will be able to verify
the router is trusted.

A reverse trust relationship can also be established from the router
to the client,<sup>[3][]</sup> and the router can be configured to
_only_ accept authenticated clients via the `Require-Authenticated`
configuration setting, and only authenticated [federation
links][federation] using `Federation.Require-Authenticated`.

<li id="fn1-tls">

<p> If the router holds a certificate signed by one of the root
    Certification Authorities (CA's) trusted by the client
    (e.g. Verisign or Thawte), the client does not need explictly add
    the router's public key to its chain of trust: it will be accepted
    as trusted because a trusted CA has signed it.</p>

<li id="fn2-tls">

<p> This is known as a <em>self signed</em> key, meaning that it has
    no chain of trust associated with it: the chain starts and ends
    with the key. You can also arrange for a commercial CA to validate
    and sign this key, which means receivers of the exported public
    key certificate chain will trust the key if they trust the CA that
    signed it, rather than needing to import your public key
    manually.</p>

</li>

<li id="fn3-tls">

<p>This is more commonly done with client federation links (where the
   client is the router with the <code>Federation.Connect</code>
   option) than normal clients.</p>
