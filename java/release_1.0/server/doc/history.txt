Release 1.1.0 (August 27, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release adds support for multi-router federation.

 * Added full support for version 1.0 of the Elvin federation
   protocol. Avis 1.1 can now form federation networks with other Avis
   routers and Mantara elvind 4.4.

 * The license for Avis has been changed from GPL version 2 to GPL
   version 3.

 * The router now supports the "Listen" configuration option to allow
   listening on multiple network addresses.

 * Improved invalid subscription reporting. The router now responds
   with EXP_IS_TRIVIAL for constant subscriptions.

 * The source code has been broken out into server, client and common
   packages to better support the client and server side packages.

 * The router now enforces stricter compliance on subscription
   expressions. In regard to identifiers this means that expressions
   with no space betwen identifier and punctuation like "size(name)"
   are no longer valid. This is not optimal, and may change in a
   future release: it is recommended to use spaces to avoid ambiguity.


Release 1.0.2 (August 9, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release corrects a number of errors in the router and brings the
subscription language parser in closer compliance with the
specification. All users are advised to upgrade.

 * When encoding multibyte UTF-8 characters in strings, the router was
   not calculating the length correctly. This would lead to protocol
   violation and disconnection.

 * The router was erroneously expanding C-style escapes in strings
   (\n, \t, etc) to their equivalvent in a C string (newline, tab,
   etc).

 * The router was not applying default connection limits in its
   configuration file (e.g. Packet.Max-Length) to client connections,
   meaning they were effectively being ignored.

 * When a packet exceeded the maximum length (Packet.Max-Length,
   default 1 megabyte), the router was generating confusing error
   message rather than notifying the reason in the log and in the
   reply to the client.

 * Field names may now contain a wider range of characters without
   requiring escapes.

 * Real number acceptance is slightly stricter: in particular, real
   numbers with no leading digit are no longer accepted, e.g. ".4".


Release 1.0.1 (May 20, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release corrects two bugs in the router. All users of 1.0 are
advised to upgrade.

Bug fix: the router was ignoring "acceptInsecure" in subscription
modification (SubModRqst) messages. This meant that a client may
receive insecure notifications when it had requested only secure
delivery in the case that the subscription was created with
acceptInsecure = true, but a subsequent SubModRqst change had set it
to false.

Bug fix: in subscription expressions size () was not defined for
strings, only opaque values.


Release 1.0 (March 24, 2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release focus: provide a baseline stable release with full Elvin 4.0
compatibility for subsets A & B of the protocol (i.e. minus quench).

Change summary:

* Added RPM distribution.

* Updated to Apache MINA 1.0.2.

* The number of socket IO threads is now set to the number of
  available CPU's + 1.

* Expanded website, including an installation guide.

* Source code cleanups and re-organisation.

* Quench requests are now vetoed with the NOT_IMPL error code.

* Updated connection options to match Elvin 4.0 spec changes.


 Release 0.7 (December 27, 2006)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release focus: improve ease of router installation and
configuration. Added installers/packages for Mac OS X, Fedora Core and
Windows. Router now supports configuration options via -c switch.

Change summary:

 * Upgraded to Apache MINA 1.0.1.

 * Quench requests now generate (non-standard) 2299 NACK code to avoid
   making clients think they've triggered a protocol violation. This
   results in better behaviour when using quench from je4.

 * Added support for configuring server using configuration file with
   -c option.

 * Added Unix-specific options -pidfile, -logfile and -daemon to
   bin/avisd.sh.

 * Client connection options are now case-independent.

 * Added packaging wrappers for Mac OS X, Fedora Core (should be
   fairly straightforward to port to other *nix) and Windows.


Release 0.6 (December 3, 2006)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Release focus: improve server's ability to handle misbehaved/malicious
clients.

Change summary:

 * Fixed error in buffer-limiting code which caused errors for large
   packets.

 * Added input queue bandwidth throttling to enforce
   Receive-Queue.Max-Length. This should go a long way towards
   protecting server from being swamped by noisy clients.

 * Added various malicious client tests to observer server's response
   to high loads, large frames and deliberate attempts to exhaust
   resources.

 * Some attack windows reduced by implementing limits for
   Subscription.Max-Count, Subscription.Max-Length,
   Connection.Max-Keys and Subscription.Max-Keys. Still lots of work
   to do here though: for example client can still trigger server to
   run out of heap using lots of subscriptions of
   Subscription.Max-Length.

 * Various extensions and fixes for SimpleClient used for testing.

 * Network.Coalesce-Delay option is now Transport.TCP.Coalesce-Delay.

 * Vendor ID is now sent with compatible name also.

 * Reduced verbosity of -v option.


Release 0.5 (November 20, 2006)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Public project info created: website and README.txt with
   instructions on how to get started.

 * Added enforcement for Packet.Max-Length connection option. Other
   (unsupported) size-related options changed so server doesn't lie if
   client cares about these.

 * Added handling for client protocol violations. All protocol
   violations now trigger session close with NACK if appropriate.

 * Ported from Apache MINA 0.8 API to Apache MINA 1.0 API.


Older releases
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* 0.4: Nov 5, 2006: First public release on sourceforge.net. Added
  concurrency support that ensures consistency when changing
  subscriptions/keys. Implemented initial connection options handling
  based on new spec, with compatibility support: options accepted but
  not implemented yet, all sizes are limited only by memory and no
  queue priority is available yet.

* 0.3: Oct 15, 2006: Implemented SHA-1 security schemes, unotify,
  quench placeholder.

* 0.2: Oct 2, 2006: Completed full subscription expression support.

* 0.1.2: Sep 30, 2006: fixed a few other minor bugs.

* 0.1.1: Sep 30, 2006: fixed threading bug.

* 0.1: Sep 30, 2006: first cut to David: no math ops in sub exprs,
  parser would not accept function names as fields, no security,
  unotify.

* Sep 11, 2006: Project started.
