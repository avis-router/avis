* flexible

* easy

* fast

* federatable

* stop thinking in terms of protocols & networks, point to point:
  think bus instead one to one, one to many, one to none. Protocol
  becomes simpler, extension possible. Removes distinction between
  server and client, who initiates connection, auto reconnection,
  service discovery. Security standard.

* Bus allows snooping, proxying, logging, etc. Like HTTP don't need to
  understand contents
