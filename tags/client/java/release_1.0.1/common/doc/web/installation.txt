Installing Avis
======================================================================

Avis install packages are available from [the sourceforge download
area][downloads]. See the relevant section below for more information.

Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before installing Avis, you will need a Java 5 (or later) runtime or
development kit installed. Windows and Unix users can get Java from
[Sun's Java download site][sun_java]. Mac OS X 10.4 users can get Java
5 from [Apple's download site][apple_java].

You can run Avis with a minimal Java Runtime Environment (JRE) but if
you wish to get optimal performance, it is recommended you install the
full JDK to gain access to the "server" optimizing VM.

Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Avis router will install and run with no configuration
required. If you do wish to change any of the router's default
parameters, these are specified in a file called `avisd.config`. See
the installation instructions for your platform below for information
on where this file can be found.

Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install, run the self-installer package. By default this will
install Avis in `C:\Program Files\Avis`.

You may also elect to add Avis as a system service, which will run
Avis in the background as a startup service. If you don't wish to add
Avis as a service at install time, you can add it later by running
`bin\install_avis_service.cmd`.

Once installed, Avis will either already be running (if you installed
it as a service), or you may start it from the command line using
`bin\start_avis_service.cmd`.

Configuration options for Avis can be found in the
`config\avisd.config` file.


Fedora
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Avis RPM is targeted and tested on Fedora Core 2 and
later. However the RPM is architecture-independent and not
particularly dependent on Fedora, so it may work on other RPM-based
Linux distributions. It has not however been tested outside of Fedora,
so use at your own risk.

To install:

<pre>
  > sudo rpm -ivh avis-1.0.rpm
</pre>

Configuration options are in the file `/etc/avis/avisd.config`.

To run from the command line as a test:

<pre>
  > /usr/sbin/avisd -c /etc/avis/avisd.config
</pre>

To install as a startup service:

<pre>
  > sudo /sbin/chkconfig --add avisd
  > sudo /sbin/chkconfig avisd on
  > sudo /sbin/service avisd start
</pre>

To uninstall as a system service:

<pre>
  > sudo /sbin/service avisd stop
  > sudo /sbin/chkconfig avisd --del
</pre>

To uninstall:

<pre>
  > sudo rpm -e avis
</pre>


Mac OS X
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install, open the Avis `.tbz` archive in Finder. This will extract
 the Avis installation package which you can open and install.

To configure: The Avis configuration is in
`/usr/local/etc/avis/avisd.config`.

To start Avis, open a Terminal window and, as an admin user, run the
command:

<pre>
  > sudo SystemStarter start Avis
</pre>

To stop Avis:

<pre>
  > sudo SystemStarter stop Avis
</pre>

To uninstall: Mac OS X unfortunately does not have a standard way to
uninstall installer package (`.pkg`) files. You can however use a
third party utility called [DesInstaller][desinstaller] to selectively
delete installed packages.


Other
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Avis source distribution comes with precompiled binaries ready to
run on any platform. Simply unzip the source distribution and run Avis
from a bash command shell:

<pre>
  > ./bin/avisd
</pre>

See `etc/avisd.config` for configuration options.
