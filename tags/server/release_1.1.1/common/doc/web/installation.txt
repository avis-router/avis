Installing Avis
======================================================================

Avis install packages are available from [the sourceforge download
area][downloads]. See the relevant section below for more information.

Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before installing Avis, you will need a Java 5 (or later) runtime or
development kit installed. Windows and Unix users can get Java from
[Sun's Java download site][sun_java]. Mac OS X users can get Java 5
from [Apple's download site][apple_java] (Mac OS X 10.4 or later).

You can run Avis with a minimal Java Runtime Environment (JRE) but if
you wish to get optimal performance it is recommended you install the
full JDK to gain access to the "server" optimizing VM.

Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Avis router will install and run with no configuration
required. If you do wish to change any of the router's default
parameters, these are specified in a file called `avisd.config`. See
the installation instructions for your platform below for information
on where this file can be found. Documentation and templates for the
config options can be found in file itself.

Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install, run the self-installer package. By default this will
install Avis in `C:\Program Files\Avis`.

You may also elect to add Avis as a system service, which will run
Avis in the background as a startup service. If you don't wish to add
Avis as a service at install time, you can add it later by running
`bin\install_avis_service.cmd`.

Once installed, Avis will either already be running (if you installed
it as a service), or you may start it from the command line using
`bin\start_avis_service.cmd`.

Configuration options for Avis can be found in the
`config\avisd.config` file.


Fedora
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Avis RPM is targeted and tested on Fedora Core 2 and
later. However the RPM is architecture-independent and not
particularly dependent on Fedora, so it may work on other RPM-based
Linux distributions.

To install:

      > sudo rpm -ivh avis-1.1.rpm

Configuration options are in the file `/etc/avis/avisd.config`.

To run from the command line as a test:

      > /usr/sbin/avisd -c /etc/avis/avisd.config

To install as a startup service:

      > sudo /sbin/chkconfig --add avisd
      > sudo /sbin/chkconfig avisd on
      > sudo /sbin/service avisd start

To uninstall as a system service:

      > sudo /sbin/service avisd stop
      > sudo /sbin/chkconfig avisd --del

To uninstall:

      > sudo rpm -e avis

Mac OS X
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install, open the Avis `.tbz` archive in Finder. This will extract
the Avis installation package which you can open and install.

To configure: The Avis configuration is in
`/usr/local/etc/avis/avisd.config`.

To start Avis, open a Terminal window and, as an admin user, run the
command:

      > sudo SystemStarter start Avis

To stop Avis:

      > sudo SystemStarter stop Avis

To uninstall: Mac OS X unfortunately does not have a standard way to
uninstall installer package (`.pkg`) files. You can however use a
third party utility called [DesInstaller][desinstaller] to selectively
delete installed packages.


Other
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Avis source distribution comes with precompiled binaries ready to
run on any platform. Simply unzip the source distribution and run Avis
from a bash command shell:

       > cd avis-1.1.0/server
       > ./bin/avisd

See `etc/avisd.config` for configuration options.
