Avis Client Library
======================================================================

The Avis Client Library provides a high level API for Java clients
communicating with an Elvin router. It is based on the same
foundations as the Avis router, but is made available under the terms
of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) rather than the GPL
used by the router.

 * [View Javadoc API documentation][javadoc] for the latest version of
   the library.

 * A description of the [Elvin subscription language][subscription].

Examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------


The client library package contains a number of programming examples
in `src/examples` and documentation on how to use them in
`doc/examples.txt`. The examples are:

  * [HelloWorld.java](client-library/examples/HelloWorld.java.html). A
    single class creates two Elvin client connections, one sending the
    traditional "Hello World" message as a greeting, the other one
    listening for all greetings and printing them to the console.

  * [WallBroadcaster.java](client-library/examples/WallBroadcaster.java.html)
    and
    [WallReceiver.java](client-library/examples/WallReceiver.java.html). This
    example uses two console applications to simulate a simple Unix
    "wall"-style command that broadcasts text to a number of consoles.

  * [SecureSender.java](client-library/examples/SecureSender.java.html)
    and
    [SecureReceiver.java](client-library/examples/SecureReceiver.java.html). In
    this example we set up a situation where a sender wants to ensure
    that only receivers it trusts can see its messages.

You can also see a demonstration of the client library in a realistic
scenario at the [examples page][examples].
