Avis Client Libraries
======================================================================

The Avis project provides client libaries for development of
applications that wish to interact with an Elvin router. There are
currently libraries for Java and C.

Java Client Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Avis Java Client Library provides a high level API for Java
clients communicating with an Elvin router. It is based on the same
foundations as the Avis router, but is made available under the terms
of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) rather than the GPL
used by the router.

 * [Download the Java client library][java-client-src] (latest stable
   version ${java-client.version}: see the [Sourceforge download
   page][client-all] for older releases).

 * [Javadoc API documentation][java-apidoc] for the latest version of
   the library.

### Examples

The Java client library package contains a number of programming
examples in `src/examples` and documentation on how to use them in
`doc/examples.txt`. The examples are:

  * [HelloWorld.java](client-library/examples/HelloWorld.java.html). A
    single class creates two Elvin client connections, one sending the
    traditional "Hello World" message as a greeting, the other one
    listening for all greetings and printing them to the console.

  * [WallBroadcaster.java](client-library/examples/WallBroadcaster.java.html)
    and
    [WallReceiver.java](client-library/examples/WallReceiver.java.html). This
    example uses two console applications to simulate a simple Unix
    "wall"-style command that broadcasts text to a number of consoles.

  * [SecureSender.java](client-library/examples/SecureSender.java.html)
    and
    [SecureReceiver.java](client-library/examples/SecureReceiver.java.html). In
    this example we set up a situation where a sender wants to ensure
    that only receivers it trusts can see its messages.

You can also see a demonstration of the Java client library in a
realistic scenario at the [examples page][examples].

C Client Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The C client library is currently still in development. An alpha
release (${c-client.version}) is available for testing.

 * [Download the C client library][c-client-src] (alpha release
   ${c-client.version}.

 * [C API documentation][c-apidoc] for the latest version of the
   library.
