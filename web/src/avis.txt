About Avis
======================================================================

Avis is a high-performance event router. It provides a fast
publish/subscribe event routing service compatible with the commercial
Elvin implementation developed by [Mantara Software][mantara].

Elvin routers can be federated together to form wide-area event
notification networks. Clients can exchange events with other clients
anywhere on the bus by subscribing to messages using pattern-matching
expressions that select messages based on their content.


Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Current uses for Elvin routers include providing a message bus for
[instant messaging and presence][tickertape.org], device discovery and
coordination for [Livespace smart meeting rooms][livespaces], and as a
carrier of [distributed speech transcription for meetings][AuTM]. The
commercial implementation developed by Mantara has been used
extensively for high-volume financial transaction routing.

Elvin has been useful in a wide variety of applications due to its
robust, lightweight nature and ability to be federated to form
wide-area messaging networks. See [this page][why_avis] for more
discussion on why you might want to use Elvin. The [examples][] page
also demonstrates a simple scenario that illustrates its use.


Current Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Avis is a compatible drop-in replacement for Mantara's commercial
`elvind` if quenching (for discovery of subscriptions) is not
required. As of release 1.1, Avis supports [federation][] with other
Elvin-compatible routers.

See the [roadmap page][roadmap] for more information on what's planned
for Avis.


History
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elvin orginated as a project at the [Distributed Systems Technology
Centre][DSTC_wikipedia] (DSTC), a Cooperative Research Centre, which
operated from 1992 until mid 2006. During this time Elvin was
incorporated into a number of DSTC projects and adopted by several of
DSTC's partners, such as the [Australian Defence Science and
Technology Organisation][DSTO] (DSTO).

In 2003 Mantara Software Inc was created as a DSTC spin-off commercial
entity in order to further develop and market Elvin. When Mantara
announced it would stop offering Elvin as a stand-alone product,
Matthew Phillips implemented the Elvin open specifications published
at [elvin.org][] as free software in the form of the Avis project.

The Avis project aims to support ongoing development using the proven
Elvin message bus approach. It is intended that Avis will track
developments in the Elvin specifications in order to remain a
compatible long-term option.

The name "Avis" derives from the French word *avis*, meaning *advice*
or *notification*.
