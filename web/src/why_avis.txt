Why Avis?
======================================================================

Avis supports building systems using the Elvin publish/subscribe
message bus architecture, an approach which shifts the network
architecture up a level from being in terms of protocols and
point-to-point networking, to being based on the concept of a
connectionless, flat event space.

Adaptable Communications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A message bus supports arbitrary communications topologies: one to
one, one to many, many to many. Clients simply emit and receive
messages on the bus &mdash; there is no direct connection required
between them, they simply receive messages they've nominated an
interest in if another client somewhere on the bus emits them.

A message bus can be used to implement traditional client-server
request-reply protocols, but can also support other kinds of
communications, such as message broadcast (e.g. instant messaging,
SNMP device monitoring, stock tickers, RSS news) and discovery
(e.g. software service discovery, Bonjour, UPnP).

Protocols, Statelessness, Security
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A uniform message format means communication protocols become oriented
around message content rather than on-the-wire encoding formats and
network stacks.

The bus architecture encourages a stateless connection between clients
where possible, and often obsoletes the issues of deciding who
initiates a connection, how to handle disconnection and reconnection,
and how to find the service to connect to.

In a message bus architecture security becomes a matter of deciding
who can and cannot receive which messages and how they're federated
across trust boundaries. Security will never be easy, but this
approach can help to focus on where to apply it.

Lightweight Messaging
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elvin messaging is easy to add to a client application: adding the
client library and a few lines of code are needed to subscribe or emit
a message &mdash; no factories, registries, queues, databases or
network configuration are required.

Deciding to experiment with Elvin is a low cost decision &mdash; Avis
provides an easy to install package which requires no configuration or
other dependencies.

While Elvin's simplicity makes it easy to get started, its flexibility
allows it to scale to more complex jobs. Once an Elvin router is
available somewhere on the network, it may become a convenient
resource for other applications, and federating it with other routers
allows to to be scaled up for bigger projects.

Speed
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An Elvin message router only delivers messages to clients that are
interested in them, and Elvin's subscription language allows clients
to be specific enough that they don't receive messages they're not
interested in.

Because the router is stateless, does not need to support guaranteed
delivery, transactions or durable subscriptions, and optimises the way
it scans for matching subscriptions, it can achieve very high message
throughputs. This allows it to be used for near real-time
applications.<sup>[1][]</sup>

In fact, although Elvin may be initially be thought of as a peer to
enterprise messaging systems such as JMS it really falls somewhere
between IP multicast and more heavyweight messaging systems.

Best Effort Delivery
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Elvin protocol does not provide an absolute guarantee of delivery,
just a best-effort attempt. If this sounds scary, first hand
experience indicates that many systems simply do not require
absolutely guaranteed message delivery, especially given the
significant cost associated with providing such a guarantee.

Costs of guaranteed delivery include slower delivery speed and complex
supporting infrastructure: a guaranteed delivery system needs a
persistent, transactional message store, tracking for what clients
have received which messages, acknowledgment of message receipt,
etc. Such systems store a lot of state on the server, which makes
server failover, load-balancing and federation much harder.

However, if you need absolute guaranteed message delivery or durable
subscriptions, you may find a heavyweight enterprise messaging system
such JMS a more appropriate choice, especially if you're already using
a Java EE or .NET system where such a choice will allow you to
integrate better with other components.<sup>[2][]</sup>

Where To Use An Elvin Bus
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elvin is just one of a number of message bus middleware standards,
which include enterprise standards such as the Java Messaging System
(JMS) and wide-area messaging systems such as XMPP.
 
The Elvin bus has three key features that make it different:

 * It's considerably less complex and lighter-weight than other
   messaging systems, but can scale to large systems.

 * The stateless routing approach is naturally conducive to high
   performance, allowing it to be used for applications that send lots
   of messages and need them delivered fast.

 * Its design incorporates support for efficient [federation][] of
   multiple routers into wide-area event routing networks.

Elvin is also an open standard and available as Free Software.

Current Uses
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elvin has become a core component of a number of projects at DSTC,
DSTO, and several academic institutions.

Elvin has been used:

 * To implement a wide-area instant messaging and presence network
   across several organisations,

 * To provide communication and service control for [smart meeting
   spaces (Livespaces)][livespaces],

 * For RSS news dissemenination,

 * To route Stock trade notifications.

Elvin has also been used in a number of projects where it simply
provides a convenient way to instrument or otherwise send a message
from a program or service (e.g. instrumenting a web application).
