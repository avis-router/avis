Federation
======================================================================

Elvin routers can be federated together to form wide-area event
notification networks. A federated network of Elvin routers appears to
provide a single space of events to clients.

Federation Classes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To federate two routers you first need to decide which events to
exchange. For trusted routers this may be simply be all events,
however you will usually want to be more specific as to what you want
to accept and provide.

In Avis, a _federation class_ is used to specify events to import and
export using [subscription expressions][subscription]. For example,
you might define a `Public` federation class that allows [tickertape
and presence][tickertape] events in and out using:

<pre>
<span class="variable-name">Federation.Subscribe</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = \
  Presence-Protocol == 1000 || string (Message)

<span class="variable-name">Federation.Provide</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = \
   Distribution == "world" &amp;&amp; \
   (Presence-Protocol == 1000 || string (Message))
</pre>

This example class allows any tickertape or presence event into the
router, but only events with a `Distribution` field with the value
"world" to be federated outwards.

Connecting Routers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To connect two routers you need to decide which one initiates the
connection and which listens for connections. The router that
initiates the connection needs a line like:

<pre>
<span class="variable-name">Federation.Connect</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = ewaf://public.elvin.org
</pre>

This specifies that the router should connect to `public.elvin.org`
using the `Public` federation class.

Incoming Connections
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To have a router listen to for incoming federation connections you
might have an entry like:

<pre>
<span class="variable-name">Federation.Listen</span> = ewaf://0.0.0.0:2916
</pre>

This listens for incoming federation connections on port 2916 on all
network interfaces.

The host that listens for incoming connections also needs a mapping
from a remote host to a federation class to use for the
connection. For example, to specify that connections from the host
`public.elvin.org` should use the `Public` federation class, and that
any hosts you manage called in the `somewhere.org` domain use the
`Internal` class:

<pre>
<span class="variable-name">Federation.Apply-Class</span>[<span class="constant">Public</span>] = public.elvin.org
<span class="variable-name">Federation.Apply-Class</span>[<span class="constant">Internal</span>] = *.somewhere.org
</pre>

You can also define a default mapping for hosts that do not match any
of the `Apply-Class` mappings:

<pre>
<span class="variable-name">Federation.Default-Class</span> = Public
</pre>

As a security measure, if there is no mapping for a host either via
`Apply-Class` or `Default-Class`, then it will be refused federation
access.

See the comments in `etc/avisd.conf` file for more information on
setting up federation.

Using TLS Authentication
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To use TLS authentication to restrict federation to routers that you
have established a pre-existing trust relationship with, you first
need to either [exchange certificates][trust] to establish trust, or
use certificates signed by the root Certification Authorities (CA's)
trusted by both routers.

Once a trust relationship is established, you can set up secure
federation endpoints in `avisd.config`. For example, the settings
below create a federation link to a trusted host named
`hex.somewhere.org`.

<pre>
<span class="variable-name">Federation.Listen</span> = ewaf:/secure/0.0.0.0:29160

<span class="comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="comment">Require that hex.somewhere.org be TLS-authenticated
</span><span class="variable-name">Federation.Require-Authenticated</span> = hex.somewhere.org

<span class="variable-name">Federation.Apply-Class</span>[<span class="constant">Trusted</span>] = hex.somewhere.org

<span class="variable-name">Federation.Subscribe</span>[<span class="constant">Trusted</span>] = \
  Presence-Protocol == 1000 || string (Message)

<span class="variable-name">Federation.Provide</span>[<span class="constant">Trusted</span>] = TRUE
</pre>

This creates a secure listening endpoint on port 29160, and ensures
that any host connecting to it that claims to be `hex.somewhere.org`
is authenticated against its public key certificate in our keychain
(or the root CA's chain of trust): this means that address-spoofing or
other nefarious techniques cannot be used to access the trusted
federation link.<sup>[1][]</sup>

<p> If you're thinking this sort of security thing would be better
    handled at a lower level than Avis, you're probably right. If
    you're using IPv6 you could choose to deal with security at the
    transport layer. With IPv4 you're stuck with either TLS at the
    application layer, or using a proxy/firewall arrangement in front
    of the router.</p>
